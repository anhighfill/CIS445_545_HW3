    <h1>Reflection on My Life Goals</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        I try to be the best person I can be everyday, because that is what my parents taught me growing up. I value honesty, hardwork and dedication, and acts of service,
        both in myself and in others. Being a good person isn't hard, and I think we need more good people in the world. I try to spread as much positivity and love through 
        every relationship I make in my life, and I try to find people that are the same. <br><br>

        As for my time in school, I value my education over many things in life. I am aware I have been blessed to have the opportunity to go to private grade school, high school,
        and now university. I struggled for a few years adapting to online school during the COVID-19 pandemic, but I have since done better in school. I love learning new things, and 
        I hope someday I am able to implement everything I have learned over the years into real life work.
