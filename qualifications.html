    <h1>My Experience</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        I have never been completely sure on what I want to pursue for a career when I finish college. This has always been a difficult topic
        to talk about for me, because I struggle with finding what I want to do, and the future is only a year and a half away for me. I know that technology only becomes more important each and every day 
        with its evolvement, so I figured pursuing a career centering technology would be a smart thing to do. <br><br>
        I have had one internship at a non-profit organization, The Center for Youth and Family Services, in the IT department, and I was able to learn
        what is managed and done in an IT department of a company of that size. I was faced with many things that I was unfamiliar with, but I had the opportunity
        to learn and be hands on with stuff I don't get to learn in school. I don't think working in an IT office is something I necessarily want to do, but it was a good experience.
        My favorite part of it was taking apart computers and replacing hardware, troubleshooting hardware issues, because I had no idea how to do this prior. <br><br>
        I have taken full courses on Java and C++, and I have little experience with Git and GitHub, web development, JavaScript, and Linux. However, I am always willing to learn more!
