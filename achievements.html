    <h1>My Achievements</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        I have many hobbies that I pursue in my free time. My favorite thing to do is travel.
        I love seeing new places, and I love being outside. When I travel, I like to camp, hike, and explore.
        I visited 12 states for the first time this past summer. <a href ="photos.html">Click here for a few photos.</a>  
        Some other hobbies of mine are photography, painting, reading, and tae kwon do. 

        The thing I am most proud of are my accomplishments in the martial art of tae kwon do. I have just recently been 
        presented my 4th degree black belt and will now be working toward my 5th.
