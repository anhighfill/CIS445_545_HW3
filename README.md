First, I created my HTML profile page.
Second, I created my profile css file for design.
I added another HTML page with photos.
I added another css file with image design requirements.
I pushed everything at once, because I was not able to push to remote repo. Instead, I made a local repo and added it to GitHub.

Made separate pages for my website.
Used javascript in form.html.
