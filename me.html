    <h3>Biography</h3>
    <p>
        My name is Ashley Highfill. I was born and raised in Peoria, Illinois, and I am 20 years old. Before going to Bradley University,
        I attended private grade school and high school in Peoria. I decided I wanted to stay living in my hometown and save my money, so I decided 
        to apply to major in Computer Information Systems at Bradley University. I have since added a minor in Criminology and a Software, Web, and Computer Security concentration.
