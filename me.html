    <h1>My Profile</h1>
    <hr>
    <h4>Biography</h4>
    <p>
        My name is Ashley Highfill. I was born and raised in Peoria, Illinois, and I am 20 years old. Before going to Bradley University,
        I attended private grade school and high school in Peoria. I decided I wanted to stay living in my hometown and save my money, so I decided 
        to apply to major in Computer Information Systems at Bradley University. I have since added a minor in Criminology and a Software, Web, and Computer Security concentration.

    <h4>Values and Beliefs</h4>
    <p>
        I try to be the best person I can be everyday, because that is what my parents taught me growing up. I value honesty, hardwork and dedication, and acts of service,
        both in myself and in others. Being a good person isn't hard, and I think we need more good people in the world. I try to spread as much positivity and love through 
        every relationship I make in my life, and I try to find people that are the same.
    </p>
    <h4>Career Aspirations</h4>
    <p>
        I have never been completely sure on what I want to pursue for a career when I finish college. This has always been a difficult topic
        to talk about for me, because I struggle with finding what I want to do, and the future is only a year and a half away for me. I know that technology only becomes more important each and every day 
        with its evolvement, so I figured pursuing a career centering technology would be a smart thing to do. <br><br>
        I have had one internship at a non-profit organization, The Center for Youth and Family Services, in the IT department, and I was able to learn
        what is managed and done in an IT department of a company of that size. I was faced with many things that I was unfamiliar with, but I had the opportunity
        to learn and be hands on with stuff I don't get to learn in school. I don't think working in an IT office is something I necessarily want to do, but it was a good experience.
        My favorite part of it was taking apart computers and replacing hardware, troubleshooting hardware issues, because I had no idea how to do this prior.
    </p>
    <h4>Interests and hobbies</h4>
    <p>I have many hobbies that I pursue in my free time. My favorite thing to do is travel.
        I love seeing new places, and I love being outside. When I travel, I like to camp, hike, and explore.
        I visited 12 states for the first time this past summer. <a href ="photos.html">Click here for a few photos.</a>  Some other hobbies of mine are photography, painting, reading, and tae kwon do.
